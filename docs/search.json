    "section": "❓ The Problem",
    "text": "❓ The Problem\nThe challenge that bike-sharing programs consistently need to overcome is the availability of bikes at any given time and location. Demand varies according to time of day, weather, and season, complicating the issue further. Without an accurate forecast, riders may be confronted with either empty stations or delayed service, defeating the very purpose of convenience these programs aim to provide. A data-driven approach will accurately forecast bike demand and thus allow for better planning in the interest of operational efficiency."

    "section": "🔍 What We Looked At",
    "text": "🔍 What We Looked At\nTo address this challenge, we analyzed a detailed dataset from Seoul’s bike-sharing program. The dataset included:\n\nWeather Data: These include temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility, factors that might be very influential in people’s decisions to ride or not.\nTemporal Information: Patterns concerning the time of day, day of week, and season. For instance, rush hour and summer days are periods of high demand.\nEvent Indicators: Data regarding holidays and whether the system was up or not; holidays tend to have lower demand, while weekdays are usually more consistent.\n\nWe cleaned up the data before diving into the analysis. One thing we noticed was that the “Dew Point Temperature” variable was basically telling us the same thing as regular temperature - they moved up and down together. Since it wasn’t adding any new insights and could actually mess with our machine learning predictions, so we decided to drop it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCurious about the issue? Check out this link.\n\n\n\n🌦️ How Weather Affects Bike Demand\nWeather plays a huge role in bike-sharing. Factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed directly influence people’s decisions to get on a bike. For instance, higher temperatures usually increase the number of cyclists, while very low temperatures or high humidity may decrease the number. Time of day and events such as holidays are also important. The morning and evening hours of commuting have the highest demand, while holidays usually have fewer rentals because of the reduced number of work commutes."

    "text": "🔄 Training and Validation\nTo ensure our models made accurate predictions, we split the data into two parts:\n\nTraining data: Used to teach the models.\nTesting data: Used to evaluate how well the models learned.\n\nWe also applied Cross-Validation, a method that divides the training data into multiple subsets and rotates between training and validating. This approach ensures the model’s performance is consistent and not based on luck. For example:\n\nThe data is split into five subsets.\nEach subset is used as a validation set once, while the remaining four are used for training.\nThe results from all validation sets are averaged to gauge overall accuracy.\n\nThink of this as teaching someone to cook. First, they practice using most of the recipes in a cookbook. Then, they are tested on a few hidden recipes. Repeating this process multiple times gives a more reliable assessment of their skills.\n\n\nSource: Cross-validation"

    "section": "💡 Key Insights",
    "text": "💡 Key Insights\nOur analysis revealed several valuable insights into the factors that influence bike-sharing demand:\n\nSeasonal Patterns:\nOne of the clearest trends was the seasonal variation in bike rentals. Demand was highest in summer, particularly during commuting hours (morning and evening), as warmer weather encouraged more people to cycle. In contrast, winter saw a significant drop in rentals due to colder temperatures and potentially hazardous conditions like snow or ice. Spring and autumn showed moderate demand, aligning with their milder weather. As shown in the graph, summer sees a much higher rented bike count compared to winter, where the count is relatively low and concentrated in the bottom-left region\nHolidays vs. non-holidays: Another important finding was the difference in demand between holidays and non-holidays. On holidays, rentals were significantly lower, likely because fewer people were commuting to work or school. In contrast, weekdays saw higher and more consistent demand, reflecting the regular schedules of commuters. As illustrated in the box plot, bike rental counts on non-holidays have fewer outliers and shorter whiskers, indicating more consistent demand compared to holidays, which exhibit greater variability and a higher number of outliers.\nModel Comparison:\nThe Decision Tree model outperformed Ridge Regression, achieving an R² score of 0.8, meaning it explained 80% of the variation in bike-sharing demand. Ridge Regression, while simpler, achieved an R² score of 0.68, indicating limitations in capturing complex, non-linear relationships. Scatter plots comparing predicted and actual values further illustrated the Decision Tree’s accuracy, particularly for lower-demand scenarios. While there were some mispredicted points (mainly in the top-left corner), the overall predictions were relatively accurate.\n\nIn contrast, Ridge Regression showed a much higher degree of variation, especially in high-demand scenarios. The model struggled to predict higher rental counts accurately, with several points in the top-left corner being significantly off."

    "section": "📢 Why It Matters",
    "text": "📢 Why It Matters\nThese insights are not just academic—they have real-world implications for bike-sharing companies and their users.\n\nPlacing Bikes Where They’re Needed: During peak times, such as summer mornings, bike-sharing companies can allocate more bikes to residential areas to meet commuter demand. Similarly, stations near offices and train stations might need extra bikes in the evenings.\nReducing Wait Times: By predicting demand more accurately, companies can ensure that users rarely face empty bike racks or full return stations, improving the overall user experience.\nImproving Operational Efficiency: Data-driven decision-making can help companies reduce waste, such as the costs of moving bikes unnecessarily or maintaining underutilized stations. Optimized bike-sharing systems also contribute to broader societal goals. By making cycling more convenient and reliable, these programs encourage sustainable transportation, reducing car usage and cutting greenhouse gas emissions."

    "text": "📌 Conclusion\nOur project demonstrates the power of data science in solving real-world challenges. By analyzing patterns in weather, time, and events, we developed predictive models that can help bike-sharing programs meet demand more effectively. While the Decision Tree model outperformed Ridge Regression, both approaches highlighted the importance of using data to drive decisions. Looking ahead, incorporating additional data, such as real-time weather updates or social events, could improve prediction accuracy. Exploring advanced techniques like ensemble models—combinations of multiple machine learning algorithms—might also yield better results. Ultimately, the success of this project underscores the value of data-driven solutions in urban planning. By leveraging data science, bike-sharing companies can enhance their operations and contribute to a more sustainable and efficient future for cities worldwide."

    "section": "📋 Methods",
    "text": "📋 Methods\nTo predict bike-sharing demand, we tested two machine learning models: Decision Tree and Ridge Regression and each model brought unique strengths to the table.\nDecision Tree\n\nThink of this model as a flowchart that splits the data into smaller groups based on patterns. For example, it might first look at the temperature, then the time of day, and figure out how these factors affect bike demand. Decision Trees are great for identifying complex patterns in the data, especially when the relationships aren’t straightforward.\nTo explain how a Decision Tree works, I’ve included a simple example about classifying birds. Here’s how the model splits the data step by step:\n  - First, it checks if the animal can fly.  \n  - Next, it checks if it lays eggs or has feathers.  \n  - Based on this information, it classifies the animal as a bird (like a penguin or a sparrow) or a mammal (like a bat).  \n\n\n\nSource: Decision Tree\n\n\nRidge Regression:\n\nA simpler, linear model, Ridge Regression creates a straight-line relationship between features and outcomes. While less flexible than Decision Trees, Ridge Regression is more resistant to overfitting and provides a useful benchmark for comparison. I won’t go into much detail here, but if you’d like to learn more about Ridge Regression, feel free to check this out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou need to be familiar with Linear Regression and linear algebra to understand Ridge Regression."
