This level of convenience, which many urban commuters now take for granted, is made possible by the power of data science. Behind the scenes, predictive models analyze a variety of factors—like weather patterns, time of day, and even holidays—to ensure bike-sharing systems are optimally prepared to meet demand.\nOur project sought to address a key question: how can weather and time-related factors help predict bike-sharing demand? Using data science, we aimed to uncover patterns in bike usage, enabling better resource allocation and improved user satisfaction. The importance of this work cannot be overstated—bike-sharing programs are a critical part of sustainable urban transport systems, offering an eco-friendly alternative to cars and helping to solve the “last-mile problem.”\nThis essay outlines our approach, from data collection to model selection, and highlights key insights that can help bike-sharing companies optimize their services.\n\n\nThe Data\nThe foundation of any predictive model is the data it relies on, and our project was no exception. We used a dataset from Seoul’s bike-sharing system, which provides comprehensive records of hourly bike rentals along with information about weather, time, and events. This dataset included the following features:\n\nWeather Data:\n\nKey weather indicators such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility were provided. These factors significantly influence bike-sharing demand, as users are less likely to cycle in extreme weather conditions. For instance, high humidity or strong winds might deter users, even if temperatures are moderate.\n\nTime Information:\n\nTemporal features like the hour of the day, the day of the week, and the season were included to capture daily and seasonal trends. For example, morning and evening commuting hours typically see spikes in bike usage, while weekends might have more leisure-related rentals.\n\nEvent Indicators:\n\nFeatures like holidays and whether the bike-sharing system was operational on a given day were critical for identifying demand fluctuations. Holidays often see a drop in rentals due to reduced commuting activity, while system outages can lead to temporary dips in usage.\n\n\nOne of the first steps in our analysis was ensuring the dataset was clean and reliable. We carefully checked for missing values, inconsistencies, and redundant variables. For instance, we removed the “Dew Point Temperature” variable, which was highly correlated with temperature and added no additional predictive value. This step reduced noise in the data and ensured our models could focus on the most relevant features.\n\n\nMethods\nTo predict bike-sharing demand, we tested two machine learning models: Decision Tree and Ridge Regression. Each model brought unique strengths to the table.\n\nDecision Tree:\n\nThis model works like a flowchart, splitting data into smaller subsets based on patterns it identifies. For example, it might split data first by temperature and then by the hour of the day, learning how each factor impacts demand. Decision Trees are particularly effective at capturing non-linear relationships, making them well-suited to complex datasets like ours.\n\nRidge Regression:\n\nA simpler, linear model, Ridge Regression creates a straight-line relationship between features and outcomes. While less flexible than Decision Trees, Ridge Regression is more resistant to overfitting and provides a useful benchmark for comparison.\n\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we split the dataset into “training” and “testing” subsets, with 70% of the data used for training and 30% reserved for testing. This split allowed us to evaluate the models on unseen data, ensuring their predictions were generalizable.\nWe also applied a technique called Cross-Validation, which involves repeatedly testing the model on different subsets of the data to optimize its performance. For example, in a 5-fold Cross-Validation, the dataset is divided into five parts, and the model is trained on four parts while being tested on the fifth. This process is repeated five times, and we average out the results from each of these models to make model robust.\nFinally, we used the R² score as our evaluation metric. This score measures how well a model predicts the outcome, with higher values indicating better performance. Think of the R² score as a measure of how well the features in the dataset explain the outcome. For example, an R² score of 0.8 means that 80% of the variation in bike rentals is explained by the features, compared to simply using the mean value of all outcomes.\n\n\nKey Insights\nOur analysis revealed several valuable insights into the factors that influence bike-sharing demand:\n\nSeasonal Patterns:\nOne of the clearest trends was the seasonal variation in bike rentals. Demand was highest in summer, particularly during commuting hours (morning and evening), as warmer weather encouraged more people to cycle. In contrast, winter saw a significant drop in rentals due to colder temperatures and potentially hazardous conditions like snow or ice. Spring and autumn showed moderate demand, aligning with their milder weather. As shown in the graph, summer sees a much higher rented bike count compared to winter, where the count is relatively low and concentrated in the bottom-left region\n\nHolidays vs. non-holidays: Another important finding was the difference in demand between holidays and non-holidays. On holidays, rentals were significantly lower, likely because fewer people were commuting to work or school. In contrast, weekdays saw higher and more consistent demand, reflecting the regular schedules of commuters. As illustrated in the box plot, bike rental counts on non-holidays have fewer outliers and shorter whiskers, indicating more consistent demand compared to holidays, which exhibit greater variability and a higher number of outliers.\n\nModel Comparison:\nThe Decision Tree model outperformed Ridge Regression, achieving an R² score of 0.8, meaning it explained 80% of the variation in bike-sharing demand. Ridge Regression, while simpler, achieved an R² score of 0.68, indicating limitations in capturing complex, non-linear relationships. Scatter plots comparing predicted and actual values further illustrated the Decision Tree’s accuracy, particularly for lower-demand scenarios. While there were some mispredicted points (mainly in the top-left corner), the overall predictions were relatively accurate.\n\nIn contrast, Ridge Regression showed a much higher degree of variation, especially in high-demand scenarios. The model struggled to predict higher rental counts accurately, with several points in the top-left corner being significantly off.\n\n\nWhy It Matters\nThese insights are not just academic—they have real-world implications for bike-sharing companies and their users. 1. Placing Bikes Where They’re Needed: During peak times, such as summer mornings, bike-sharing companies can allocate more bikes to residential areas to meet commuter demand. Similarly, stations near offices and train stations might need extra bikes in the evenings. 2. Reducing Wait Times: By predicting demand more accurately, companies can ensure that users rarely face empty bike racks or full return stations, improving the overall user experience. 3. Improving Operational Efficiency: Data-driven decision-making can help companies reduce waste, such as the costs of moving bikes unnecessarily or maintaining underutilized stations. Optimized bike-sharing systems also contribute to broader societal goals. By making cycling more convenient and reliable, these programs encourage sustainable transportation, reducing car usage and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur project demonstrates the power of data science in solving real-world challenges. By analyzing patterns in weather, time, and events, we developed predictive models that can help bike-sharing programs meet demand more effectively. While the Decision Tree model outperformed Ridge Regression, both approaches highlighted the importance of using data to drive decisions. Looking ahead, incorporating additional data, such as real-time weather updates or social events, could improve prediction accuracy. Exploring advanced techniques like ensemble models—combinations of multiple machine learning algorithms—might also yield better results. Ultimately, the success of this project underscores the value of data-driven solutions in urban planning. By leveraging data science, bike-sharing companies can enhance their operations and contribute to a more sustainable and efficient future for cities worldwide."
