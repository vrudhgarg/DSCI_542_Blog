# Introduction  
Have you ever walked up to a bike-sharing station and found it empty just when you needed a ride? Frustrating, right? What if bike-sharing systems could predict exactly when and where people will need bikes, ensuring they're always available? That’s where data science comes in!

Our project explored how weather, time, and events impact bike-sharing demand. Using data from Seoul’s bike-sharing system, we developed predictive models to uncover patterns and provide insights that could help bike-sharing companies improve their services. 

### The Problem
Bike-sharing programs face the ongoing challenge of ensuring bikes are available where and when they’re needed. Fluctuating demand, influenced by factors like time of day, weather, and season, makes this task even more complex. Without accurate predictions, riders may encounter empty stations or delays, undermining the convenience these programs are designed to offer. A data-driven solution is crucial to accurately forecast bike demand and enable better planning for efficient operations.

### What We Looked At
To address this challenge, we analyzed a detailed [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand) from Seoul’s bike-sharing program. The dataset included:

1. Weather Data: These include temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility, factors that might be very influential in people's decisions to ride or not.
2. Temporal Information: Patterns concerning the time of day, day of week, and season. For instance, rush hour and summer days are periods of high demand.
3. Event Indicators: Data regarding holidays and whether the system was up or not; holidays tend to have lower demand, while weekdays are usually more consistent.

We cleaned up the data before diving into the analysis. One thing we noticed was that the "Dew Point Temperature" variable was basically telling us the same thing as regular temperature - they moved up and down together. Since it wasn't adding any new insights and could actually mess with our machine learning predictions, we decided to drop it.

# How Weather Affects Bike Demand
Weather plays a huge role in bike-sharing. Factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed directly influence people's decisions to get on a bike. For instance, higher temperatures usually increase the number of cyclists, while very low temperatures or high humidity may decrease the number.

Time of day and events such as holidays are also important. The morning and evening hours of commuting have the highest demand, while holidays usually have fewer rentals because of the reduced number of work commutes.

# The Data Behind the Study
We used a dataset from Seoul’s bike-sharing system. This dataset included:

Weather Data: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility.
Time Data: Hour of the day, day of the week, and season.
Event Indicators: Holidays and system functionality (e.g., whether the bike-sharing program was operational).
To ensure accuracy, we cleaned the data by removing unnecessary variables like "Dew Point Temperature," which didn’t add value to our predictions. This step ensured our models focused only on meaningful factors.

# Methods  
To predict bike-sharing demand, we tested two machine learning models: Decision Tree and Ridge Regression. Each model brought unique strengths to the table.  

1. Decision Tree:  
   - This model works like a flowchart, splitting data into smaller subsets based on patterns it identifies. For example, it might split data first by temperature and then by the hour of the day, learning how each factor impacts demand. Decision Trees are particularly effective at capturing non-linear relationships, making them well-suited to complex datasets like ours.  

2. Ridge Regression:  
   - A simpler, linear model, Ridge Regression creates a straight-line relationship between features and outcomes. While less flexible than Decision Trees, Ridge Regression is more resistant to overfitting and provides a useful benchmark for comparison.  

To ensure accuracy, we split the dataset into “training” and “testing” subsets, with 70% of the data used for training and 30% reserved for testing. This split allowed us to evaluate the models on unseen data, ensuring their predictions were generalizable.  

We also applied a technique called Cross-Validation, which involves repeatedly testing the model on different subsets of the data to optimize its performance. For example, in a 5-fold Cross-Validation, the dataset is divided into five parts, and the model is trained on four parts while being tested on the fifth. This process is repeated five times, and we average out the results from each of these models to make model robust.

Finally, we used the R² score as our evaluation metric. This score measures how well a model predicts the outcome, with higher values indicating better performance. Think of the R² score as a measure of how well the features in the dataset explain the outcome. For example, an R² score of 0.8 means that 80% of the variation in bike rentals is explained by the features, compared to simply using the mean value of all outcomes.

# Key Insights  
Our analysis revealed several valuable insights into the factors that influence bike-sharing demand:  

1. Seasonal Patterns:  
One of the clearest trends was the seasonal variation in bike rentals. Demand was highest in summer, particularly during commuting hours (morning and evening), as warmer weather encouraged more people to cycle. In contrast, winter saw a significant drop in rentals due to colder temperatures and potentially hazardous conditions like snow or ice. Spring and autumn showed moderate demand, aligning with their milder weather.
As shown in the graph, summer sees a much higher rented bike count compared to winter, where the count is relatively low and concentrated in the bottom-left region
 

Holidays vs. non-holidays:
Another important finding was the difference in demand between holidays and non-holidays. On holidays, rentals were significantly lower, likely because fewer people were commuting to work or school. In contrast, weekdays saw higher and more consistent demand, reflecting the regular schedules of commuters.
As illustrated in the box plot, bike rental counts on non-holidays have fewer outliers and shorter whiskers, indicating more consistent demand compared to holidays, which exhibit greater variability and a higher number of outliers.
 
3. Model Comparison:  
The Decision Tree model outperformed Ridge Regression, achieving an R² score of 0.8, meaning it explained 80% of the variation in bike-sharing demand. Ridge Regression, while simpler, achieved an R² score of 0.68, indicating limitations in capturing complex, non-linear relationships.
Scatter plots comparing predicted and actual values further illustrated the Decision Tree's accuracy, particularly for lower-demand scenarios. While there were some mispredicted points (mainly in the top-left corner), the overall predictions were relatively accurate.
 

In contrast, Ridge Regression showed a much higher degree of variation, especially in high-demand scenarios. The model struggled to predict higher rental counts accurately, with several points in the top-left corner being significantly off.

 
# Why It Matters
These insights are not just academic—they have real-world implications for bike-sharing companies and their users.
1.	Placing Bikes Where They’re Needed:
During peak times, such as summer mornings, bike-sharing companies can allocate more bikes to residential areas to meet commuter demand. Similarly, stations near offices and train stations might need extra bikes in the evenings.
2.	Reducing Wait Times:
By predicting demand more accurately, companies can ensure that users rarely face empty bike racks or full return stations, improving the overall user experience.
3.	Improving Operational Efficiency:
Data-driven decision-making can help companies reduce waste, such as the costs of moving bikes unnecessarily or maintaining underutilized stations.
Optimized bike-sharing systems also contribute to broader societal goals. By making cycling more convenient and reliable, these programs encourage sustainable transportation, reducing car usage and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

# Conclusion
Our project demonstrates the power of data science in solving real-world challenges. By analyzing patterns in weather, time, and events, we developed predictive models that can help bike-sharing programs meet demand more effectively. While the Decision Tree model outperformed Ridge Regression, both approaches highlighted the importance of using data to drive decisions.
Looking ahead, incorporating additional data, such as real-time weather updates or social events, could improve prediction accuracy. Exploring advanced techniques like ensemble models—combinations of multiple machine learning algorithms—might also yield better results.
Ultimately, the success of this project underscores the value of data-driven solutions in urban planning. By leveraging data science, bike-sharing companies can enhance their operations and contribute to a more sustainable and efficient future for cities worldwide.
